Team Umber Hulk is creating a space strategy game inspired by a board game by Azlen (age 11) and Eric (age 10).

The goals of the game are to maintain the largest and most powerful empire of planets. Each turn you may conquer planets (or journey to them), or harvest resources from your existing pool of planets. As you expand the range of your dominion, your score goes up, but watch out for hungry raiders on your flanks!
